    "The method we do classification is that we collect words in training reviews and put all of them into two piles(positive count and negative count) of words according to the given label of training data. Then we compute the ratio of occuracencies of each word in positive and negative classes and we take its log value, which means if the log value is much greater than 0, then a certain word is more likely to be considered as a positive word since it appears more in positive reviews. For each of our testing review, we count if words appears more as a positive word or not by computing the it's log ratio we previously computed with a kind of threshhold. We first set the threshold as (-0 , +0),  which means if the log ratio is greater than +0, we classify it as a positive word, negative otherwise. But we found the accuracy is very low(65%) and we think the reason is that there are too many vavague or neural words that just happens to appear more in positive and negative reviews and their log ratios are nearby 0. Since there are many of them, they will bring a lot of uncertainties to our classification model and cause mis-classifications. When we set threshold (-0.3, +0.3), the accuracy gets much better (76.2%, shown as our output above). And we are curious how the accuracy will change when we keep increasing the range of ratio of words we don't want to use. We find that the accuracy will be maximized with threshold (-1 , +1) and accuracy is 80.6%. It starts to drop when we keep increasing the range. We know everything depends on our training review, so the accuracy will vary a lot by different kind of reviews, but we at least find some patterns of the accuracy of our model.   "

    "We put many sets of result data to make it easier to compare both accuracy and running time under different situations. We first compare data of (-0 , +0) and (-0.4 , +0.4) for 1 hidden layer and 10 units, we can see that (-0.4 , 0.4) is much faster than (-0.1 , 0.1) because when we set a low ignore-word range, we are leaving much more words to the input vector so that the matrix multiplication $w^Tx$ will take more time. However, we can see that their final accuracy is very close and both are higher than approach 1. To both (-0 , +0) and (-0.4 , +0.4), when they have 1 layer and increase their units to 50 in those layers, both of their final training accuracy get decreased but performance of testing accuracy varies. When (-0 , +0) and (-0.4 , +0.4) has two layers and 10 units each layer, we can see the both running time and accuracy are getting better, which means if there are two strategies, having a single layer with many units, and having more layers and less units, we may want to use the second strategy. And increasing units for multiple layers may not increase testing accuracy significantly but will definitely increase running time by few seconds. Also as we can see, when we increase number of epochs, complex models as two layers neural network with 50 units each layer will have almost the same accuracy compare to the result when there are only 50 epochs."
